[More info on installing WP plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins)


**Usage**

Visit the SBS settings page to configure your shortcodes. Then copy/paste the shortcodes in any Post, Page, or Widget to display your stats. To display your stats anywhere in your theme template, visit the Template Tags section of the settings page.


**Shortcodes**

Visit the plugin settings page for a complete list of shortcodes. There you may customize the output of each shortcode. Here is a list of all SBS shortcodes:


	[sbs_posts]                = number of posts
	[sbs_posts_alt]            = number of posts (for sites with LOTS of posts)
	[sbs_pages]                = number of pages
	[sbs_drafts]               = number of drafts
	[sbs_comments]             = number of comments
	[sbs_moderated]            = moderated comments
	[sbs_approved]             = approved comments
	[sbs_users]                = number of users
	[sbs_cats]                 = number of categories
	[sbs_tags]                 = number of tags
	[sbs_tax tax="tax_name"]   = number of taxonomy terms
	[sbs_word_count id="1"]    = number of words in post 1
	[sbs_word_count_all]       = number of words in all posts
	[sbs_updated]              = site last updated
	[sbs_latest_posts]         = displays recent posts
	[sbs_latest_comments]      = displays recent comments
	[sbs_roles role="all"]     = number of users per role
	[sbs_cpts_count]           = list of CPT counts
	[sbs_cpt_count cpt="post"] = number of any post type
	[sbs_blog_stats]           = displays list of blog stats
	[sbs_logged_users]         = number of logged-in users
	[sbs_media_count]          = number of media files (see note below)


**[sbs_posts]**

The `[sbs_posts]` shortcode accepts several attributes that can be used to customize your post stats:

* `cat` - limit by category (default: empty = all cats)
* `tag` - limit by tag (default: empty = all tags)
* `type` - limit by post type (default: empty = post)
* `status` - limit by post status (default: empty = publish)

So by default, `[sbs_posts]` with no attributes will display the total number of published posts in any category or tag. 

Here is an example that makes use of the attributes:

	[sbs_posts cat="sci-fi" tag="sequel" type="movie" status="draft"]

So this will display all drafts of the custom post type "movie" that are in the "sci-fi" category and tagged as "sequel".

For the `[sbs_posts_alt]` shortcode, it is not as flexible, but does provide a couple of attributes:

	[sbs_posts_alt type="page" status="draft"]

You can change the `type` and `status` of the posts that should be counted.


**[sbs_media_count]**

The `[sbs_media_count]` shortcode can display stats for any media type(s). Here are some examples:

	[sbs_media_count type="all"]          = displays number of all media files
	[sbs_media_count type="image"]        = displays number of image files
	[sbs_media_count type="video"]        = displays number of video files
	[sbs_media_count type="pdf,doc,docx"] = displays number of PDF, DOC, and DOCX files
	[sbs_media_count type="mp3"]          = displays number of MP3 files
	[sbs_media_count]                     = displays number of all media files


__Tip:__ you can display only the number (and no text) for certain shortcodes. For example:

	[sbs_cpt_count cpt="post" txt="null"]
	[sbs_roles role="subscriber" txt="null"]

By setting the value of `txt` to `null`, only the number is displayed. Or you can change the `txt` value to whatever you want.

More information about the possible values for these attributes:

* [cat](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Category_Parameters)
* [tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Tag_Parameters)
* [type](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Type_Parameters)
* [status](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Status_Parameters)


**More Shortcodes**

Here you can find information about any new/custom shortcodes and attributes.

__Get number of posts with taxonomy term__

To get the number of posts that belong to a specific post type and taxonomy term, add the following shortcode:

`[sbs_tax_posts tax="taxonomy" terms="term-1, term-2, term-3" type="custom-post-type"]`

Then change the attribute values to match your taxonomy, terms, and post type, respectively.


__Display the number of comments for any category__

To display the number of comments that exist for a specific category, add the `cat` attribute to the `[sbs_comments]` shortcode, like so:

`[sbs_comments cat="1"]`

Then you can change the category ID to your category.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How do I use the count-word shortcode?**

There are three ways to count words:

	[sbs_word_count]         // displays word count of current post
	[sbs_word_count id="1"]  // displays word count of post with ID = 1
	[sbs_word_count_all]     // displays word count for all published posts


**How do I use the user-role shortcode?**

There are three ways to display user roles:

	[sbs_roles]                // displays list of roles and number of users
	[sbs_roles role="author"]  // displays number of users for specified role
	[sbs_roles role="all"]     // displays list of roles and number of users


**How to limit/customize the number of counted posts?**

The plugin provides a filter hook for customizing the total number of posts that are displayed using the `[sbs_posts]` shortcode. To do it, add the following snippet to your theme functions.php file:

	function sbs_get_posts_limit_custom($limit) { return 100; }
	add_filter('sbs_get_posts_limit', 'sbs_get_posts_limit_custom');

No changes need made; simply edit the `100` to whatever is desired and done.
